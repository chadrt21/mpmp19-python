Matt Parker's Math Puzzles: The 19 Challenge - http://www.think-maths.co.uk/19challenge 

Challenge: "If you square all of the first 19 primes and add them you get a multiple of 19.
            Enter any number n where the first n primes squared, add to a multiple of n. Any n â‰  1 counts, but bigger is better!"

Instead of generating the primes (which would be resource intensive), I downloaded lists of the first 50 million primes from [PrimePages](https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/millions/).

Required python libraries: 
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

Average run time: ~1 min 14 seconds
